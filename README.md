Problem Statement
=================
Create a life long impact on women from underprivileged groups of society by building a platform that will allow them to avail of free training and placements. Build a performance analysis tool that can record participation and performance of the women beneficiaries, and can be presented to prospective employers. 

The main objective of this tool is to improve the sustainability of the placement record. 

Solution
========
By using this tool, we provide placement opportunities matching the candidates aptitude along with technical skills, thereby improving the payscale as well as placement sustainability of the candidate. 

We will be providing a web portal where the trainers will be providing a raw input which contains the trainee(s) performance details which will be graphically represented for visual analysis and thereby addressing the issues accordingly.
